TurboControls

Collection of small windows control elements resembling 80s style displays and switches.

These were built in 2005 using bitmap artwork, so they are far too small to current 
standards in screen resolution.

They work by pre-fabrating bitmaps for every status. Should be easy to amend for 
high resolution or vector graphics.

Two projects included: TurboControl with the actual control library and TurboControlTest
containing a little demo. 

Not actively developed, but feel free to drop me a line for requests :)
